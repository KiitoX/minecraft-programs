# Summary

After trying to write this application with the Touchpoint library, I already had the base functionality working, or so I thought. The completely different approach to writing applications in the [Titanium](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/27733-titanium-graphical-user-interface-gui-framework-beta-1-xml/) framework made me redesign the whole interface again, for the better. Using XML for layout and design is certainly an odd choice (and kind of painful to program by hand, on a limited editor) it allows so much more in so much less code than a object oriented approach would require.  
A bit problematic was the lack of a full tutorial for this library, though the API documentation is very useful. This had me stumped at certain points, for example when I was trying to figure out how to mirror the application to an external monitor, but when I figured out that the only example file in the source repository changed over time, showing off new features, I was able to view earlier commits to get an idea of how to use certain functionality.
